# NYC Traffic Accidents

This Power BI project analyzes traffic accidents in New York City from 2021 to 2023, focusing on causes, outcomes, times, locations, and the types of individuals and vehicles involved.

#### Key objectives in this project:

- Identify the most common causes of traffic accidents.
- Examine traffic accident trends by year, district, and time of day.
- Analyze the impact on individuals, including injuries and fatalities.
- Understand the role of different vehicle types in accidents.
- Pinpoint accident hotspots in the city.

#### Yearly Accident Data by District

Brooklyn consistently had the highest number of accidents each year.
2021: 36K,
2022: 33K,
2023 (partial data): 7.9K.
Queens and the Bronx follow in accident counts, with Staten Island consistently reporting the fewest.

#### Accidents by Time of Day

Accidents are most frequent during the daytime (8:00-16:00) and evening (16:00-00:00). Morning accidents (00:00-8:00) are relatively fewer.

#### Accident Hotspots

Streets like the Belt Parkway and Broadway have the highest accident counts.
Belt Parkway is the top hotspot, with a consistent increase from 2021 to 2023.

## Conclusions

- Key Problem Areas: Driver distraction, passenger vehicles, and high-traffic districts (e.g., Brooklyn) are the most significant contributors to accidents.
- Time of Day: Preventive measures should target daytime and evening hours when accidents are most frequent.
- Hotspot Locations: Focused interventions (e.g., traffic calming measures) should be implemented on high-accident streets like Belt Parkway.

This project effectively highlights critical insights into traffic safety in New York, providing actionable data for urban planners and policymakers.
